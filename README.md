# chirn-prediction-with-Pyspark-
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom operator using machine learning techniques, specifically with PySpark's MLlib library. Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain them. In this project, I employ PySpark's powerful machine learning capabilities to create an accurate churn prediction model.
